# Data-Analysis-of-Road-Traffic-Accidents
This project is an analysis of datasets obtained regarding previously occurred accidents in a specific region from which inferences are drawn. The main aspects of the project converge on the inferences drawn using the different machine learning approaches on these datasets. The solution to issues faced in maintaining safety on roads also lies in the selection of which specific problems are to be tackled in which regions based on the data collected.

Problem Statement: 
“To analyse the given accident data from a particular region and to obtain inferences regarding the influences and contributions of several attributes to the severity of an accident and hence provide specific measures in order to reduce the rate of these accidents”
